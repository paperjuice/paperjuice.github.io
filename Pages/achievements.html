                    <p>I got to Derivco through university. They were looking for
                    interns over the summer but I pushed a bit and asked them if they would
                    consider me for a part-time position. They asked for my portfolio and C.V. and
                    after some time they scheduled me for an interview in which I was successful. For me this
                    was a huge achievement as I was (and still am) the only student and part-time employee.</br>
                    As a QA automation test analyst I had the following responsibilities:

                    <h1>Global Games Jam 2017</h1>
                    <p>During this Global Games Jam I was part of a team of four:
                    one project manager, one artist, one programmer and me, programmer.</br>
                    Our project was aimed for HTC Vive. The game is a first person puzzle in which you have
                    move object to certain position in order to meet the requirement and progress further.</br>
                    The objects could be moved horizontally using the controllers and in order to lift the objects
                    the player had to use voice input (the higher the pitch the stronger the push power). After a certain
                    pitch level, the object is tossed forward.</br>
                    The game can be found by following <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/sonic-projection">this link</a>.</br>
