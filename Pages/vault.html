                <h1>Vault</h1>
                <p>In "Vault" I store some of my most important projects which
                    helped me immensely to improve as a game developer but are not
                    as polished as the games featured on the "Project" page.</br>
                    Most of the games in "Vault" are developed with a focus on achieving
                    something specific such as sprite sheet animations or 3D asset optimisation
                    for mobile devices. Because my targets for these projects were for me
                    to discover, learn and improve certain skills, some games are not
                    available to play mainly because they don't offer any kind of game-play.

                    <span>Summary: </span>"Idle grim" is an idle-game in which
                    the player has to slain enemies while keeping their health up. </br>
                    Investing in both damage and armour (the two categories in which currency
                    can be invested) will allow the game to idle for a longer period of time.</br>
                    When health is depleted, the damage drops significantly.</br>
                    My main focus on the project was
                    programming and game-play designing as part of a two man team.</br>
                    While the project is very minimalistic, it did help me get started with games programming.</br>
                    Also, "Idle Grim" is the first potent game that I worked on.

                    <span>Summary: </span> "Mad Road" is a endless-runner game in which you have
                    to dodge environment  and from time to time battle foes in order to stay
                    on track and increase your score.</br>
                    My main focus with this project was optimisation. It was my first 3D game aimed for
                    smart-phone and getting the right balance between graphics quality and
                    performance was a valuable exercise.</br>
                    The game managed to run smoothly even on older Androids (e.g. LG L7),
                    The reason why is not on the "Projects" page is because I didn't carried on
                    with the game development in order to offer a complete experience and have it available
                    for the public.

                    <span>Summary: </span>"Maria Pale" is a project that was heavily relying on art.</br>
                    I am enthusiastic about every aspect of game development
                    and so I was very curious how sprite-sheet animation works, what are the tools
                    and some of the techniques  used. While this is not by far what an knowledgeable person
                    would create (pixel-art wise), I had the opportunity to peek an eye on the concept and work-flow.</br>
                    Also, 2D character programming was something new for me at that time.

                    <span>Summary: </span>The mechanic in "Soul Lust" is something I've came up
                    with and I really enjoy: the main character's health goes down every moment and
                    the player is caught in this frenzy, non-stop action. The game-play sessions are short
                    in order to keep the player focused and active. </br>
                    On this project I worked only on programming, camera and particle effects as part of a
                    two men team.</br>

                    <span>Summary: </span>Photonic Escape is a top-down
                    shooter set into a sci-fi environment.</br>
                    Your goal is to gather 50 keys and escape the maze through guardianâ€™s cave.</br>
                    This was my first attempt at creating a top-down 3D game.</br>
                    The project pushed me to work with nav meshes, A.I. and collision and stats balancing.
                    While the game doesn't have pretty aesthetics, it did help me improve and grow my love for game programming.
