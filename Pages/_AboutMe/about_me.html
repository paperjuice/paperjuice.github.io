                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>
                    My name is Dragos Dumitru, born and raised in Bucharest, Romania.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have finished a high-school focused on math and
                    informatics and right after I passed my final exams,
                    I applied for a Computer Games Design course at
                    university in UK. The reason why I chose a game design
                    course over a BSc degrees such as computer sciences is
                    because I wanted to get closer to developing games and I was a
                    huge fan of this type of entertainment for more than a decade.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Firstly, I personally believe that people tend to flatten
                    out their existence constantly living in the same loop
                    constrained by this vicious cycle in which most of their
                    time is spend working today in order to be able to quietly
                    live tomorrow. Being caught in such life doesn’t necessarily
                    mean that the individuals feel sad, but having the
                    same experience every day, constantly can just translate as
                    monotonous. Video games seem like a gateway, ironically, to
                    escape reality in order to experience strong, deep and real
                    feelings.  These experiences cannot often arise in day by day
                    activities but video games can generate them with ease if
                    developed right. Seeing people getting excited by something
                    I’ve created is priceless.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Secondly, being able to bring to life worlds, characters,
                    events is mesmerizing. Any piece of art, with the right
                    script inside the right engine can be the beginning of a
                    wonderful creation. Games bring together individuals, create
                    relationships and help people briefly disconnect from reality
                    and escape in fantastic places.
                </p>

                <p>
                    During university I focused myself on the principles of
                    good design in video games while continuing to
                    improve and develop my programming skills.
                    When it comes to designing, my main focus is how I can
                    create a fun and immersive game-play. Because I am a huge fan
                    of RPG, I always look into how I can make the player feel
                    powerful while maintaining a fair and challenging experience.
                    Because I have a background in C++, I was taught to look into
                    what would be the most efficient solution for that particular
                    problem. I try to write robust and clean code in order to make
                    it easy to read and facilitate possible refactoring at later
                    times. Because optimising games is a huge part of the game
                    development (in order to make the product available for as many
                    devices/machines as possible) I also developed games for mobile.
                    The phone I had at that time wasn’t very powerful so getting a
                    good frame-rate was something I took in consideration right
                    when I was starting any new project.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Two months after I got to university in UK I managed
                    to get my first job abroad. The reason for the rush
                    was because I like to have full control over my life.
                    With a job in hand I could manage me and my finances and get
                    a better understanding of what it means to fully support myself.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The first job I had was in a bar. I have some
                    funny experiences there to tell but it wasn’t for me.
                    Two months later I got another job at a big company.
                    Unfortunately for me, big company means many, many desks and,
                    as you probably are guessing, I was there to clean and vacuum
                    the place. The job provided me with good income and I could
                    easily do my university work, as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Eight~ months later, two representatives from Derivco, an international software development company, came to university looking for student that are suited and want to apply for an internship over the summer period. I pushed a bit and I asked them if they would consider anyone for a part-time position. They told me that they haven’t done this before but are open to have such offer for the right student. I applied for a part-time position and in February I received an e-mail from them   saying that they would like to have me for an interview. As an outcome to the interview, they liked my enthusiasm and eagerness to learn and self-develop and so I became the first part-time employee at the company and still am fourteen months later.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Derivco experience had an incredible positive impact on my development as a professional. I’ve learned and performed under real-life working methodologies, improved my communication and programming skills immensely as well as gaining brand new skills and knowledge about all sorts of tools required to complete my tasks.
                </p>

                <p>
                     After a year working as a QA automation test analyst at Derivco, because of my fast learning ability and enthusiasm for new technologies, I was proposed to join a new team as a software developer.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The new position require me to learn SQL and a new programming language called Elixir. I find this very exciting especially because it is out of my comfort zone. My mind is set on an object oriented programming way and getting to learn a functional programming language is something new and interesting. Expanding my knowledge in different sectors will be beneficial when faced with solving all sort of programming problems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At the moment I am focusing on my dissertation project as well as getting confident with Elixir.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am a huge fan of RPGs, especially if they offer high level of difficulty. As a result, for my dissertation I am working on a game that combines elements seen in the rogue-like genre, inspired by Diablo aesthetics and camera perspective and mixed with Dark Souls game-play. The whole development process can be read about by following <a href="http://paperjuiceinc.blogspot.co.uk/"  target="_blank" id="link">this link</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As I wrote above, I am a huge fan of RPGs but also I very enjoy MOBAs. The one that has a special place in my heart is Heroes of Newerth with over 1500 hours spent. I also have around 1700 hours in Diablo and around 3000 matches in League of Legends (from when it used to be enjoyable, circa 2011~). On top of these I used to spend hundreds of hours every month playing all sorts of other video games which I am very happy with.
                    Some may say that this is lost time but a friend of mine once said:
                </p>

                <p id=special_text_colour>
                    “Time spent enjoying something is not wasted time – Daniel Stan”
                </p>

                <p>
                    Video games taught me strategizing, communication with other players, coordination and time management because I had other activities too (school, volunteering events, sport etc.)
                </p>

                <p>
                    Probably my biggest achievement as a player would be place 15 in the European leader-board a couple seasons ago in Diablo. I only did stay there for like a couple minutes but I think it still counts.
                </p>

                    Apart from video games I really enjoy metal music and am an avid table-tennis player.
