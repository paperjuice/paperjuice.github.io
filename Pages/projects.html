                <h1>Projects</h1>
                <p>I truly enjoy developing games and I try my best to gain
                    as much knowledge as possible in as many related fields.
                    Therefore, in order to do so, I create games in which I cover design, art and programming.</br>
                    Different games rise different challenges and so I am pushed to experience and document myself
                    in order to reach the game's end goal.</br>
                    On this page I feature some of my most polished projects I've done.

                <p><span>Period of creation: </span>November 2016 - Present</br>

                <span>Summary: </span>"Floors of Ages" is a rogue-like in which you age instead of
                losing health upon taking damage. The main character can get older, rejuvenate and back again.
                The age influences three main stats which again influence other minor bonuses.</br>
                The story revolves around a man who's trapped underground, deep into the Earth. In
                order to reach the above he has to climb a series of floors. Every new floor brings new challanges
                as well as new powers.</br>
                Most of the sessions concludes with the death of the main character but its names will
                always be remembered. The game features an online leader-board that holds the top progresses.</br>
                A lot more about the project can be discovered by following the development blog.

                <span>Summary: </span>"Wander" is an endless, progressively harder,
                top-down runner where the goal is to get as far as possible
                without touching any of the blocks.
                Dodge the deadly walls and aim to get the highest score.</br>
                "Wander" is my first game created for a smart-phone device. It is also the most popular with
                over 800 downloads.</br>
                The project taught me to pay great attention to optimisation and user feedback. A lot of changes
                were brought to the game based on external feedback.

                type game in which you have to protect your planet
                by matching the shield colour with the meteorites'.</br>
                The game was created over a period of a week as a challenge for myself.</br>
                By doing so I've learned how to iterate fast, how to focus on major elements and keep the game
                concise and within the scope. By keeping the game simple and focused I managed to create a
                complete experience which I was able to post online.</br>

                The game features an online leader-board, six different maps and eight aesthetically
                different character.</br>

                My brother told me at some point that he would like to be part of a project
                which he can play on the go. So, we teamed-up to create "Slide Effect". The game
                idea is entirely his therefore all the credits go to him.</br>
                The project was developed in a very short amount of time. </br>
                The game can be downloaded for free from Google Play.
